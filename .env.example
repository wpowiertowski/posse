# POSSE Configuration Example

# NOTE: This project uses config.yml for configuration and Docker secrets
# for sensitive credentials stored in the secrets/ directory.
#
# For production and local development:
# 1. Create secrets directory: mkdir -p secrets
# 2. Add your secrets (use a text editor or printf to avoid shell history):
#    printf '%s' 'your_token' > secrets/pushover_app_token.txt
#    printf '%s' 'your_key' > secrets/pushover_user_key.txt
# 3. Enable in config.yml: pushover.enabled: true
#
# For CI/CD (GitHub Actions):
# - Configure secrets in repository settings (PUSHOVER_APP_TOKEN, PUSHOVER_USER_KEY)
# - Secrets are automatically written to files during workflow execution
#
# Legacy environment variable support (not recommended):
# PUSHOVER_APP_TOKEN=your_pushover_app_token_here
# PUSHOVER_USER_KEY=your_pushover_user_key_here

# Mastodon Configuration
# POSSE now supports multiple Mastodon accounts with per-account filters!
#
# Multi-account setup:
# 1. Create secret files for each account using naming convention:
#    {platform}_{account_name}_{credential_type}
#    
#    mkdir -p secrets
#    printf '%s' 'your_personal_token' > secrets/mastodon_personal_access_token.txt
#    printf '%s' 'your_work_token' > secrets/mastodon_work_access_token.txt
#
# 2. Configure accounts in config.yml:
#    mastodon:
#      accounts:
#        - name: "personal"
#          instance_url: "https://mastodon.social"
#          access_token_file: "/run/secrets/mastodon_personal_access_token"
#          filters:
#            tags: ["personal", "tech"]  # Post only content with these tags
#        - name: "work"
#          instance_url: "https://fosstodon.org"
#          access_token_file: "/run/secrets/mastodon_work_access_token"
#          filters:
#            tags: ["work"]
#            exclude_tags: ["personal"]  # Don't cross-post personal content
#
# 3. Add secrets to docker-compose.yml:
#    secrets:
#      mastodon_personal_access_token:
#        file: ./secrets/mastodon_personal_access_token.txt
#      mastodon_work_access_token:
#        file: ./secrets/mastodon_work_access_token.txt
#
# To get an access token for each account:
# 1. Go to your Mastodon instance settings
# 2. Navigate to Development -> New Application
# 3. Create a new application with 'write:statuses' scope
# 4. Copy the access token and save to appropriate secret file

# Bluesky Configuration
# POSSE supports multiple Bluesky accounts with the same structure as Mastodon!
#
# Multi-account setup example:
# mkdir -p secrets
# printf '%s' 'your_main_token' > secrets/bluesky_main_access_token.txt
# printf '%s' 'your_professional_token' > secrets/bluesky_professional_access_token.txt
#
# Configure in config.yml:
# bluesky:
#   accounts:
#     - name: "main"
#       instance_url: "https://bsky.social"
#       access_token_file: "/run/secrets/bluesky_main_access_token"
#       filters: {}  # No filters = all posts
#     - name: "professional"
#       instance_url: "https://bsky.social"
#       access_token_file: "/run/secrets/bluesky_professional_access_token"
#       filters:
#         tags: ["work", "professional"]
#
# Legacy single-account format is still supported for backward compatibility.

# Filter Options
# Filters control which Ghost posts get syndicated to each account:
#
# - tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]          # Include posts with ANY of these tags
# - exclude_tags: ["tag1"]          # Exclude posts with ANY of these tags (takes precedence)
# - visibility: ["public"]          # Filter by visibility: "public", "members", "paid"
# - featured: true                  # Only featured posts (true) or non-featured (false)
# - status: ["published"]           # Filter by status: "draft", "published", "scheduled"
#
# Empty filters ({}) or omitted filters match all posts.
# All specified filter criteria must match (AND logic), except within tags (OR logic).
